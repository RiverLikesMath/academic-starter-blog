Before thanksgiving, I asked one of my younger writing students to write a recipe. He put together these wonderful mashed potatoes. Then he asked me to share it, so (with mom and dad's permission) here it is!

Ingredients

* 6 medium round potatoes, 2 pounds
* ⅓ to ½ cup buttermilk
* 1 cup cheddar cheese
* ¼ cup butter (softened)
* ½ tbs salt
* Dash of pepper
* Canned baked beans

{{< figure src="potatoes.png" caption="From a friend who tried the first batch." alt="A text message, saying 'I had some of the potatoes last night and they were quite delicious, thank you!'">}}

Directions

* Put the potatoes in a pan, cover water over them and let the water boil.
* Cover & simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until tender
* Drain
* Mash the potato with a fork
* Add buttermilk
* Put the cheese on top  
* Add butter and salt and pepper
* Serve with warm beans

When I cooked these potatoes, they turned out really well. If you make them, please [let me know](about/#contact) how they turn out!
