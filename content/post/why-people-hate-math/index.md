*This is the second post in a series on why I like math. The first post is [here](post/why-i-love-math)*

A lot of people are afraid of math. They don't like it, it just went over their heads when they were a kid, it was fun until it wasn't. I've had students tell me, "just get me through this class so I don't have to take math anymore." So, the question is, why? 

A lot of virtual ink has been spilled on this topic. Arushi Lohia of the India Times hates math enough to [write a post about it](https://www.indiatimes.com/lifestyle/here-are-9-reasons-why-people-hate-mathematics-361567.html). Phys.org has [an excellent writeup](https://phys.org/news/2017-10-people-maths.html) from someone who loves it. In their words: 

>What do you think of when you think of maths? If you're like most people, it's probably something like: numbers, equations, boredom, anxiety and pain.
>
>Then there are the weird ones, like me, who call themselves mathematicians. When we think of maths, we think of shapes, colours, patterns, creativity, freedom, insight and the feeling of making deep connections.

Everyone seems to agree on a few things: 

**Math can feel pointless**

"When am I ever going to use this? What's the point?" It's a question I get a lot. When *do* we use math? What is the point? Why are we doing this? There are thousands of jobs and places where we use math, but we don't tend to talk about them in school. A major reason I made this website was to talk about them! I plan to fill up the [real world math tag](tag/realworldmath) tag over the coming months and years, and I started a couple weeks ago by [interviewing a contractor about the ways he uses geometry on the job](post/interview-with-a-contractor).

Scientists and engineers obviously use a lot of math, but they're not the only ones. I'm excited to tell you about it. 

**There's many ways to learn math, but it's tough to find the best one for each person**

This is where tutoring really shines. When a teacher is teaching a new topic, there's always decisions to be made. If there's multiple ways to solve a problem, do I have the time to teach all of them? Should I teach it with a drawing? What about an example with music or sound? Should I start with the definition, or an example? Certain options will work better for some students. If I'm teaching fractions to a guitar player, I'm probably going to use musical time signatures to explain them. But if I'm teaching them to someone who loves to cook, I'm going to go for examples with food, usually pizza. 

When I'm standing in front of 30 students, I go with the food example, because I think it'll help the most people. But the guitar player might've done better with time signatures.  Students can thrive when math is presented to them in just the right way. The excellent thing about tutoring is that I can tailor my lesson to each student. The tough thing about teaching - and what a lot of students deal with - is that often the way you decide to teach something to a whole class isn't right for some of the students in it. Some teachers make this worse by insisting that their way is the only way - or the best way. This can be really tough for students. There's a lot of ways to get to the right answer.

**A lot of people fall off of math in middle school.** 

Between the ages of 10 and 13, the way we teach math changes. What we ask students to do changes. something something seventh grade
