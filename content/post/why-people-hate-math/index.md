*This is the second post in a series on why I like math. The first post is [here.](post/why-i-love-math)*

Not too long ago, I put out a call to my friends who dislike math. Everyone who knows me knows I love math, but I wanted to hear from people who don't. I got a lot of responses. 

There's a lot of people out there who struggle with math. There's a lot of people who chose college degrees, jobs, careers just so they wouldn't have to every take another math class. I work with a lot of people who hate math. So, the question is, why? 

I've been thinking about that question for a long time - fifteen years, now. The more I think about it, the more I learn. There isn't one reason that people hate math. There are so, so many. It could fill a book. I might write that book one daay. 

I'm not one of those people. I love math. I always have. The first time I worked with a student who hated math, fifteen years ago, it shocked me. I think math is beautiful, an opportunity to be creative and have fun. Is that how you see it? Is that how most people see it? 

So many people see math, and they think drudgery, boredom, confusion, fear. I've helped hundreds of students learn to love math, but it's usually a slow process. People are skeptical, at first, that math is something that we can enjoy. I have to teach carefully, with a lot of patience, point out students' successes, normalize their mistakes, and let my own joy spread to my students. 

So, why? 

**Every student is different. But Every student needs different things. A lot of students don't get what they need.**

The brain is a wonderful, complicated, amazing thing. Every :brain is unique. Schools - especially when our parents were young - didn't always recognize this. I've heard stories of girls who were treated worse than boys, students with disabilities who were belittled and ignored, students who like to discuss and debate being told to be quiet.  

One particularly heartbreaking story I hear over and over: someone's struggling with math, and an adult in their life says "maybe math just isn't for you." Math is for everybody, but we have this idea that there are math people and there's everyone else. That couldn't be further from the truth. 
 
You can be you and still be good at math. You may not be able to do it exactly the same way everyone else does, but there's so many right ways to do math. When I was in college, I had a friend 
**Teachers are really important**
When I was in first grade, we had an art teacher. Every week, she would pick one student who made the best drawing, and give them a sticker. Every kid in that class got one of those stickers except for me. At that moment, when I was 6 years old, I decided I was bad at art. I believed it until I was 30. 

Teachers *matter*. Kids trust teachers. Kids absorb what teachers say. WHen I put out my call for 

A lot of people are afraid of math. They don't like it, it just went over their heads when they were a kid, it was fun until it wasn't. I've had students tell me, "just get me through this class so I don't have to take math anymore." So, the question is, why? 

I'm not the only person to ask this question. Arushi Lohia of the India Times hates math enough to [write a post about it](https://www.indiatimes.com/lifestyle/here-are-9-reasons-why-people-hate-mathematics-361567.html). Phys.org has [an excellent writeup](https://phys.org/news/2017-10-people-maths.html) from someone who loves it. In their words: 

>What do you think of when you think of maths? If you're like most people, it's probably something like: numbers, equations, boredom, anxiety and pain.
>
>Then there are the weird ones, like me, who call themselves mathematicians. When we think of maths, we think of shapes, colours, patterns, creativity, freedom, insight and the feeling of making deep connections.

That's a big difference. That article has a lot of wonderful things to say on the topic, but here's what I'd add: 

**Math can feel pointless**

"When am I ever going to use this? What's the point?" 

I get these questions a lot. When *do* we use math? What is the point? Why are we doing this? There are thousands of jobs and places where we use math, but we don't spend much time on them in school. A major reason I made this website was to talk about them! I plan to fill up the [real world math tag](tag/realworldmath) over the coming months and years, and I started a couple weeks ago by [interviewing a contractor about the ways he uses geometry on the job](post/interview-with-a-contractor).

Scientists and engineers obviously use a lot of math, but they're not the only ones. I'm excited to tell you about it. 

**There's many ways to learn math, but it's tough to find the best one for each person**

This is where tutoring really shines. When a teacher is teaching a new topic, there's always decisions to be made. If there's multiple ways to solve a problem, do I have the time to teach all of them? Should I teach it with a drawing? What about an example with music or sound? Should I start with the definition, or an example? Certain options will work better for some students. When I'm teaching a class, that's a lot tougher. 

If I'm teaching fractions to a guitar player, I'm probably going to use musical time signatures to explain them. But if I'm teaching them to someone who loves to cook, I'm going to go for examples with food, usually pizza. When I'm standing in front of 30 students, I go with the food example, because I think it'll help the most people. But the guitar player might've done better with time signatures. When I'm tutoring, I can pick the right explanation for the chef and for the musician. 

The tough thing about teaching is that often the way you decide to teach something to a whole class isn't right for some of the students in it. Some teachers make this worse by insisting that their way is the only way - or the best way. This can be really tough for students. There's a lot of ways to get to the right answer.

What I've observed is **a lot of people fall off of math in middle school.** 

Between the ages of 10 and 13, the way we teach math changes. What we ask students to do changes. The books and learning materials we use often change, too. This is the first time many students are asked to reason thoroughly with variables and all students are asked to deal with more abstract concepts. Textbooks and worksheets often get less colorful. Students play less games and spend more time solving equations. Math *changes* in middle school. 

We need to show students why these changes are happening, and how cool the new stuff can be. If we don't, they'll get bored, frustrated, confused, or scared. 

**The good news.**

If you - or your child - is someone who hates math, we can change that. Math is a skill that can be trained. With the right help and the right motivation, everyone can get better at math. You can even learn to like it. 

I've had countless students tell me that they hate math. I tell them this - I don't expect you to like math at first. Just don't be surprised if, a bit down the line, you figure out a tough problem and find yourself thinking "I did it! This is cool!"
