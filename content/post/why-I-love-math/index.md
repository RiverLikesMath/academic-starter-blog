When I was young, I didn’t know that math could be scary. The first time someone told me they hate math, I was really surprised. Yet it’s by far the most common thing that people say to me when I tell them about my profession. "Oh, you tutor math? That's really cool. I couldn't do that, I hate math."

But I love math! When I sat down to write this post, I actually got a bit of writer’s block. Where do I even start? There’s so much! Math is an escape, a refuge, a challenge, a companion, and a guide to the world. It's beautiful, exciting, and wonderful. To be honest, I couldn’t fit my love of math into one blog post. So, in this first post, I'll talk about what drew me to math as a kid.

From the moment they’re born, children are wired to learn. They love to find patterns, draw connections, reason, and jump to conclusions. I’ve met very few kindergarteners who were afraid of math. On the contrary, they’re some of my favorite people to talk to about it! They dive headfirst into the ideas I’m sharing with them. Figuring out how to count by twos is an adventure. Figuring out how five and ten go together is awesome. Figuring out the difference between a square and a circle becomes an animated discussion.

I was no different. Math had an endless series of patterns, puzzles, and ideas for me to dive into. Every time I solved a question or figured something out, I got a rush. This thrill - the thrill of learning - drives a lot of what kids do. And, while I did much more than solve equations when I was a kid - don’t get me started on Super Mario World or summer music camp - math was always a place of joy for me. There was always another question to answer, another problem to solve, another pattern to decipher, another thrill to chase. I could ask questions - and there were answers! I could find the answers by myself, or talk to someone else about them.

I remember asking people questions like “how much money does this toll booth make in a day?”, and getting answers like “how would we figure that out?”. I enjoyed the process of doing math - of working through the steps, not knowing what the answer was, but knowing that I would get there. So when I learned about multiplication, I did a lot of it. It was a sure thing in an unsure world. 

I still get the same thrill from doing math that I did when I was five. Studying differential geometry doesn’t feel that different than learning how to count. All those people I talk to, the ones who tell me they hate math? I think that many of them loved math too, when they were young. So, what happened between now and then? I’ve spent many hours thinking about what makes people hate math. In particular, I’ve got a theory about the 7th grade. Stay tuned!
