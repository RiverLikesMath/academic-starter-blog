Today is March 14th (3/14), so that means it's Pi Day! This is, no lie, my favorite day of the year. 

Pi is a number (about 3.1415926535879323846) that's the ratio between a circle's diameter and it's circumference. Pi's important when we talk about circles, electrical circuits, ocean waves, little tiny quantum particles, and all sorts of other stuff. 

Pi goes on to infinite decimal places. Some people know pi to hundreds of decimal places, but I only know 19. People often celebrate Pi Day with pie, too, and I plan to try and throw together a dessert of my own today.

For those of you into programming, the Raspberry Pi (a popular computer you can get for under $50) is named after it. Here's a link to ways you can call or calculate with pi in dozens of different programming languages: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Real_constants_and_functions

For those who like to write, you can write a Pi Poem today! Put 3 syllables, 1 syllable, and 4 syllables on each line. Here's mine: 

>I love math

>Yay!

>Let's eat some pie

Math is awesome. It's part of everything. It saves lives, powers our screens, helps us play our games, and shows up in so many places in our life. Let's celebrate that today. 

HAPPY PI DAY!
