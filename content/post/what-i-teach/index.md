So what does River tutor? I specialize in math, science, and computer programming. My students include professional developers, young children, high school students, you name it! I feel comfortable teaching people of all ages and skill levels. Here's some of the topics I can help you with: 

**Math**
 - Common Core math
 - Algebra and Pre-Algebra 
 - Geometry
 - Precalculus and Trigonometry
 - Calculus (including Multivariable Calculus)
 - Linear Algebra 
 - Discrete Math

**Science**
 - Physics (including AP Physics) 
 - Chemistry
 - Elementary and middle school science

**Programming**
 - AP Computer Science
 - Scratch, logic, Python, and coding for kids
 
If you don't see the subject you're looking for here, [ask me about it!](about#contact) I might be able to help you or point you towards someone who can. 

For example, even though I don't list web development under programming, I can help you learn some webdev skills. I also got help from some wonderful developers while making this website. They might be able to help you out if I can't.

Another example: If you're working on a subject that I'm currently brushing up on (like Abstract Algebra), I might be able to help you out. In that example, I could help you with some of the earlier topics like sets, induction, and mathematical logic. If you're solving problems that involve the Sylow Theorems or ring homomorphisms, I can't help you with those yet. 

In any case, I hope to hear from you soon!
