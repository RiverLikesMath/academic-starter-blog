So, what does River tutor? I specialize in math, science, and computer programming. My students include professional developers, young children, and everyone in between! My understanding of math (and how to teach it), especially, is so thorough that I feel comfortable tutoring it at any level. 

 Here's some of the topics I can help you with: 

**Math**
 - Common Core math
 - Algebra and Pre-Algebra 
 - Geometry
 - Precalculus and Trigonometry
 - Calculus (including Multivariable Calculus)
 - Linear Algebra 

**Science**
 - Physics (including AP Physics) 
 - Chemistry
 - Elementary and middle school science

**Programming**
 - AP Computer Science
 - Scratch, logic, Python, and coding for kids
 - Web development 

If you don't see the subject you're looking for here, [ask me about it!](about#contact) I still may be able to teach it, or point you in the direction of someone who can.
