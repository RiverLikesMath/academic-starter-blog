So, you've got a test coming up soon. You've done the best you can to prepare. *Now* what do you do?

A big part of my job is helping students prepare for tests. I've had a lot of practice giving day-before-the-test advice. Here's what I tell my students:  

**The day before the test**

  * Study, study, study.
  * Eat a good, healthy dinner.
* Spend at least 20 minutes relaxing the night before.
* Get enough sleep! Get to bed as early as you realistically can.

**The morning of:**

* Eat a good, healthy breakfast.
* Drink enough water and use the restroom before you get to class - even if the test is online! Take care of yourself physically and minimize possible distractions. Wear warm clothes if you need to.
* Get to class nice and early to ask questions and settle in.
* Make sure you understand the format of the test, whether you’re allowed to use a calculator, anything peculiar about how it works, etc. This is especially important on standardized tests like the SAT, which have strange grading systems.

**During the test:**

* Try your best! I've seen so many students leave points on the table because they gave up. You might feel like it's not worth it to try. Do your best anyways!  
* It's natural to think about your grade during the test, but do your best to focus on answering questions and solving problems. It's your teacher's job to give you a grade. Your job is to answer the questions.  
* If you're stressed, that can show up as tension in the body. Students often tense their shoulders when testing, let them drop.
* Read the whole test first. Pick the easiest questions to start with.
* Manage your time! If something’s taking too long, come back to it later.
* Read instructions and questions carefully.
* Show your work! Showing your thinking and reading the questions carefully can help your grade significantly.
* Check your work when you’re done. If you’re really not sure whether or not to change an answer, leave it.

Good luck, and have fun on your next test!
(I know, I know. But it's possible, I swear!)
