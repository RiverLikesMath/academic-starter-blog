"River, you've been a fantastic tutor! You're patient, easy to understand, and you tailor your teaching approach to my programming background. You explain things in a way that just makes sense." --*Kimberly C*

"River is very passionate about the subjects she teaches, actively studying most of them herself. She is as enthusiastic about sharing the understanding she gathers, able to patiently enumerate concepts in a myriad of ways until they click for the student. I couldn't recommend anyone more highly." -- *Steven D*

"River has an ability to understand what students' needs are and how to meet them on multiple levels. River has a strong understanding of math and she has the ability, and the know-how, to create lessons which are stimulating and creative." *-- Kent C*

"River exceeded all expectations. Her students went into their respective AP exams feeling well-prepared and confident. More importantly - the students *came out* of the exams feeling the same way... In short, River is a rising star in science education." --*Ken M*
